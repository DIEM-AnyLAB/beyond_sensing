title: "Beyond sensing: a cross-modal research"
classes: wide
---
Beyond sensing is an interdisciplinary research group by Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome. The primary objective of our research is to better understeand crossmodal perception to find inclusive solutions for people with sensory disabilities, exploiting these interaction together with neural plasticity to develop sensory substitution and augmentation devices.

At the moment, our focus is on vision and hearing, with an ongoing study on audio-visual association in synesthetic and non-synesthetic subjects and a starting project on vision integration in people with vision impairments via musical stimuli.
