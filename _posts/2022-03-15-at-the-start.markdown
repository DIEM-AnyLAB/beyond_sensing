Synesthesia is a sensorial-perceptive phenomenon in which certain stimuli evoke sensations of a different nature from that normally experienced. It can occur in different forms, one of the most common is auditory-visual synaesthesia, so when listening to music images are visualized and vice versa. The painter Vasily Vasil'evič Kandinsky, for example, said he heard choirs in his mind while he painted.

A better comprehension of the phenomenon could lead to various results:
• In the short term: studying the relationship between music, images and emotion in subjects who do not experience synaesthesia;
• In the long term: develop a teaching aid to improve learning and memory

We developed a test to investigate the role of emotion in the music-image association in non-synesthetic subjects and we are now starting to enroll patients.
