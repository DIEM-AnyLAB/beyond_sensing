A pilot group of 14 subjects has just started the image-sound association test! We expect them to complete it within the end of March.

At the end of the test they will be asked to complete a form stating the difficulties they had with the UI and what they lisked and dislied about the test. Based on this results, we will update the platform for the main group test.
