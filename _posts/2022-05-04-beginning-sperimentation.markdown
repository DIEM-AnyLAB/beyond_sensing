As of today the sperimentation has officially begun: a group of 70 candidates has started completing the test, which was modified accordingly to the suggestions of the pilot group's participant.

In the first session they will carry out short tests to check their visual and musical skills,
In the second they will be able to listen to songs, create images based on the music and express the emotions that what they heard provokes them.
In the last test, they will be shown images and asked what emotions they make them feel.
