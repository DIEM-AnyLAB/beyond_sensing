We started experimenting with children colour-music association. We let them associate the three parameters of the HSB representation of colour to three musical parameters of a chord: the fundamental note, the octave on the piano and the mode.
The table below shows results from investigating 4 children, ranging from 7 to 11 years old.

    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter associated with hue</th>

    <th>Octave on the piano</th>
    <th>fundamental note</th>
    <th>Chord's mode</th>

  </tr>

    <td>Number of times the association was chosen</td>

    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Results show that associations number 1 - 2 and 4 were the most liked. The first two were appreciated by all four children, whereas number 4 got its high score thanks to the very high score given to it by a single children, but was not rated high by the other children.
