We started experimenting with children colour-music association. We let them associate the three parameters of the HSB representation of colour to three musical parameters of a chord: the Fundamental note, the octave on the piano and the mode.
The table below shows results from investigating 4 children, ranging from 7 to 11 years old.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>Parameter associated with hue</td>
    <td>Parameter associated with saturation</td>
    <td>Parameter associated with brightness</td>
    <td>Number of times the association was chosen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.</td>
    <td>Fundamental note</td>
    <td>Octave on the piano</td>
    <td>Chord's mode</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td>Octave on the piano</td>
    <td>Chord's mode</td>
    <td>Fundamental note</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td>Fundamental note</td>
    <td>Chord's mode</td>
    <td>Octave on the piano</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td>Chord's mode</td>
    <td>Octave on the piano</td>
    <td>Fundamental note</td>

  </tr>

Results show that associations number 1 - 2 and 4 were the most liked. The first two were appreciated by all four children, whereas number 4 got its high score thanks to the very high score given to it by a single children, but was not rated high by the other children.
