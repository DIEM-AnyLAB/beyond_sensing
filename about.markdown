It was born with 3 laboratories coming together: [Electronics for Sensor System](https://www.unicampus.it/ricerca/unita-di-ricerca/elettronica-per-i-sistemi-sensoriali), [Elaboration Systems and Bioinformatics](https://www.unicampus.it/ricerca/unita-di-ricerca/sistemi-di-elaborazione-e-bioinformatica) and [Developmental Neuroscience](https://www.unicampus.it/ricerca/unita-di-ricerca/neuroscienze-dello-sviluppo).

The main objectives of the group are:
* Sensory Integration
* Sensory Substitution
* Better understanding of sensorial interactions
